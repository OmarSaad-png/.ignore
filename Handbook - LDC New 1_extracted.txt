  Dear LDC Employee,  
  
This Employee Handbook has been designed to serve as a quick reference for many i ssues

In order to remain current, the Handbook treats most topics briefly and may provide links to the 
Human Resource Policies and Procedures Manual. This Man ual is updated as official policies 
change. The Human Resources Policies and  Procedures Manual is the authority in case of a 
disparity between the Manual and the Employee Handbook.  
It is important for you to be familiar with the information in this Handbo ok. Please review it 
carefully. If you need to refer to the Handbook in the future, remember that the most recent 
version will be available on the Intranet, where the links can also be used. In addition, your 
Human Resources Department can provide assistan ce with questions relating to your 
employment.

2.3.1 CORRECTIVE ACTION  
  
LDC holds each of its  employees to certain work rules and standards of conduct. When an employee 
deviates from these rules and standards, LDC expects the employee’s supervisor to take corrective action.  
  
Corrective action at LDC is progressive. That is, the action taken in r esponse to a rule infraction or 
violation of standards typically follows a pattern increasing in seriousness until the infraction or violation 
is corrected.  
  
The usual sequence of corrective actions includes a verbal warning, a written w arning, salary de duction 
and finally end of the employment contract as per labor law. In deciding which initial corrective action 
would be appropriate, a Department Head in cooperation with the HR Department will consider the 
seriousness of the infraction,  the circumstance s surrounding the matter, and the employee’s previous 
record. Though committed to a progressive approach to corrective action, LDC considers certain rule 
infractions and violations of standards as grounds for immediate termination of emplo yment. These 
include but are not limited to:  
  
- Theft in any form.  
- Fraud.  
- Unexcused absence.  
- Vandalism or destruction of LDC property .

  2.4 EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES & FORMER EMPLOYEES   
  
2.4.1 EMPLOYEMENT OF RELATIVES  
  
LDC seeks to eliminate actual or apparent conflicts of interest which may result from having first and/or 
second degree rel atives - i.e. legal husband or wife, mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, nephew, 
niece, grandson, grand -daughter, aunt and un cle - work in the same administrative hierarchy.  
  
For the purposes of this policy, the below process must be implemen ted when hiring a new employee  
  
- Job applicants should mention in the job application their relatives working in LDC   
- LDC will not allow  the hiring of your first and second degree relatives within the same division. 
If the relation established after the e mployment, one of them should transfer to another 
department, and the company then will decide which one will be transferred and to which  
department.  
- Hiring of other relative degrees rather than the first and the second within the same department 
can be a pproved, only if they will not report directly or indirectly to each other.  
- Hiring of any relative should be subject to the approval of the HR department, hiring manager, 
the manager of the candidate’s relative, and the manager of the candidate him/hersel f. HR 
department should highlight the case before giving the candidate any promises.  
- At any point of time and due to business circumstan ces that may occur, LDC can see that there is 
a potential conflict of interest that may result because of the newly hir ing or already existing of 
any relatives. In such case, LDC has the right to apply the proper corrective action to avoid this 
conflict.  
   
2.4.2 EMPLOYEMENT OF FORMER EMPLOYEE
